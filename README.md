# public-chain-configs

A public registry for chains and asset configurations

## Getting started

Before we begin, make sure your system has the minimum runtime requirements:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Once you have `nodejs` and `pnpm`, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:axelarnetwork/public-chain-configs.git
```

cd into the folder

```bash
cd public-chain-configs
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

You're all set ðŸŽ‰
